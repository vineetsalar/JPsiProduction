These files contain the Equation of State s95p-v1.2 based on
description by Huovinen and Petreczky in arXiv:0912.2541. Below 188 MeV
temperature, the EoS is based on hadron resonance gas with the same
resonances as in the UrQMD hadron cascade (see the resonance list in
pdUrQMD3.3.dat file), and above 188 MeV it is based on the lattice result
by Bazavov et al., Phys.Rev.D80, 014504 (2009).

The files

    s95p-v1.2_Teospar.dat
    s95p-v1.2_Teosdens.dat

contain the EoS tabulated as function of temperature, i.e. on a
equidistant temperature grid with 1 MeV spacing. The file
s95p-v1.2_Teospar.dat contains the thermodynamical parameters,
i.e. temperature (in MeV) and chemical potentials. The file
s95p-v1.2_Teosdens.dat contains energy density (GeV/fm^3), pressure
(GeV/fm^3), entropy density (fm^-3) and net baryon density
(fm^-3). Chemical potentials and baryon density are zero everywhere.
The lines on both files correspond to each other, i.e. the nth line
in s95p-v1.2_Teospar.dat gives a temperature and the nth line in
s95p-v1.2_Teosdens.dat gives the corresponding densities and pressure.
This slightly clumsy format was chosen to enable extension to finite
baryon number density in the future.

	s95p-v1.2_par7.dat, s95-v1.2_dens7.dat

contain the EoS as function of energy density, i.e. on equidistant
energy density grid(s).

All the files begin by two lines with

    e0
    de	ne

where e0 is the lowest energy density of the grid, de grid spacing and
ne the number of grid points, i.e. lines.

In the s95p-v1.2_par*.dat files the thermodynamical parameters,
temperature (in GeV, first row) and chemical potentials are tabulated
from the third line on. The s95p-v1.2_dens*.dat files contain the
densities from the third line on. First line is energy density (in
GeV/fm^3), second pressure (in GeV/fm^3), third entropy density (in
fm^-3), fourth net baryon density (in fm^-3) and the fifth a plasma
fraction of the fluid (zero below 188 MeV, one above 220 MeV, lineary
proportional to temperature in the transition region 188 < T < 220
MeV). The lines on par* and dens* files correspond to each other,
i.e. the nth line in s95p-v1.2_par*.dat gives a temperature and the nth
line in s95p-v1.2_dens*.dat gives the corresponding densities and
pressure. Note that the densities and temperature in the files run
from the highest value _down_.

The file

        pdUrQMD3.3.dat

contains the hadrons and resonances included in the hadron resonance
gas. The format is explained at the end of the file.
